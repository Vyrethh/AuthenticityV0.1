# Password Brute Force Tool (Prototype)

**For educational purposes only.**

Very early-stage password attack tool — noisy and limited. Built for reference, not real use yet.

Requires:
- Python 3 (older version for `telnetlib`)
- `paramiko`
- `defaults.txt` password list

Planned improvements:
- Stealth mode
- `rockyou.txt` support
- Requirements auto-installer
- Tools like Enervo/Nexora (future integration)

Do not clone — real version coming soon.
