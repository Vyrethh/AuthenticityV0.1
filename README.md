THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY

This is a PROTOTYPE of a dictionary/brute force password red team tool, it is LOUD, and you need paramiko, and telnetlib which is NOT even on the newest python3, so you'll have to use an older version if you want to use it, also need the defaults.txt

either way i'm going to add a requirements.txt and it'll just download all the stuff for you, so.... like i said before
this is a prototype, and will NOT work unless you have those things... also it's limited
i'm gonna add a bunch of stuff to this, like probably a stealth mode, i'll add rockyou.txt, and a couple other password text files, and a bunch of other stuff, so do NOT clone this repo, this is just here so i can reference back to it when i make the real thing,
wait for the real thing, it'll be crazy i'll porobably add enervo and nexora to this thing all at once
